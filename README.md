## Description
This application was my term project for my Android Development course. The goal of the term project was to familiarize myself with the Android Framework and the development process of building a mobile application.

Spendr is a budgeting app that allows you to set a monthly budget and track your daily spending. You will be able to see how your money is being spent and budget accordingly. There is a dashboard where you can see your total monthly expenses and total yearly expenses.
